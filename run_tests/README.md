Catch-all folder containing notebooks and scripts running our experiments.

**Note** that the directory structure of this repository has been changed since the code was last edited.
Much of the code, therefore, may attempt to load data (using relative paths) that has since been moved to a different location.

The scripts "cole_esn_test.py", "cole_eesn_test.py", "lcesn_test.py", and "run_all.py" should still work, but the others likely won't.
